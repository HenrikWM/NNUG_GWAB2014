NNUG - Global Windows Azure Bootcamp 2014
=========================================

This is a collection of workshop assignments that were given at NNUGs Global Windows Azure Bootcamp 2014 @ Bouvet 29. March 2014.

## Assignments overview

The assignments will act as a step-by-step guide in which you will be introduced to the process of creating an **Azure Cloud Service**, **Azure Virtual Network**, **Point-to-Site VPN**, **Azure Virtual Machine** running **Ubuntu** with **elasticsearch** and finally an elasticsearch-cluster of your own.

The *end*-folder contains the final individual solution where you have your own ASP.net MVC website querying your own elasticsearch cluster in Azure.

The *GWAB2014*-folder contains the code for the common ASP.net MVC website querying the common elasticsearch cluster.
